        <div class="description">
            The story begins with Geralt of Rivia, Crown Princess Ciri of Cintra, <br> and the quarter-elf sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg at different points in time, 
            exploring formative events that shape their characters throughout the first season, <br> before eventually merging into a single timeline.<br>
            Geralt and Ciri are linked by destiny since before she was born when he unknowingly <br> demanded her as a reward for his services by invoking "the Law of Surprise".<br>
            After the two finally meet, Geralt becomes the princess's protector and must help her <br> and fight against her various pursuers to prevent her Elder Blood and powerful magic from being used for malevolent purposes and keep Ciri and their world safe. <br>
